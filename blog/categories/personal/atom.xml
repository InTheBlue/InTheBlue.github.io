    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today marks my first time on a motorbike, a Suzuki SV650 to be specific. I wasn't the driver, I was riding pillion while my housemate Rich was in control. Before I even got on the bike I had to work hard to remain calm and not think about how snug and claustrophobic the helmet felt. In a way it was fairly reassuring to know how secure my heat was, but I've never been good in confined spaces. Rich breifed me on the do's and don'ts before we set off, making sure I knew to keep stil and not fidget if the bike was moving slowly or was stationary.</p>

<p>I was immediately surprised by how wind there was around us, not just from us moving forwards, but a strong crosswind as well and that unnerved me for a while. Then that took a backseat while I was being stunned by how quickly the bike could accelerate. After a while I stopped thinking about the helmet, ignored the bumps in the road, didn't care about the huge amount of wind around me and embraced the feeling of flying along on what felt like a guided missile.</p>

<p>I've never felt anything like it and I've not had that much fun in a very long time. And then it was over before I knew it, Rich had somewhere he needed to be, so we'd only done town roads. But in a few weeks we should be riding up to Huntingdon for a blast down some winding roads. And I can't wait.</p>
